## Project 1: ATM Touchscreen Interface

### Description

This project involved designing a touchscreen interface for an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) with a 10" x 10" square touchscreen. The ATM features a modern iPhone-style multi-touch interface with no physical buttons, requiring a complete redesign of the traditional ATM experience.

### Features

- **Core Functionalities**:
  - Entering a PIN for authentication.
  - Fast cash withdrawal options ($20, $40, $60, $80, $100).
  - Custom withdrawal amounts.
  - Balance checking for both checking and savings accounts.
  - Deposits for any amount.
- **User-Centered Design**:
  - Designed for a broad range of users, including the elderly.
  - Solutions for touch mismatches, ensuring intuitive and accurate interactions.
  - Clear navigation between screens.

### Submission

- Mockups for the interface screens are included in the project folder, highlighting the navigation flow and functionality.

## Final Project: Peaches Academy Online Exam Registration (PACOER) System

### Description

This project focused on designing a user interface for the PACOER system, which manages external examination registration records for Peaches Academy students. The system supports multiple user roles, including administrators, students, subject teachers, and the exam coordinator.

### Features

- **User Roles and Tasks**:
  - **Administrators**:
    - View and print class lists.
    - Monitor payment statuses.
    - Access registration lists by subject and examination body.
  - **Students**:
    - Update profiles and upload proof of payment.
    - Drop subjects, request reviews, and view registration statuses.
  - **Exam Coordinator**:
    - Update student and teacher information.
    - Generate invoices and finalize exam registrations.
    - Print class lists and payment statuses.
  - **Subject Teachers**:
    - Recommend students for subjects.
    - View subject-specific reports.

- **Interface Design**:
  - Based on the provided paper-based registration form.
  - Includes fields for personal details, subject information, and administrative use.
  - Mockups illustrate the navigation and interactions for each user role.
